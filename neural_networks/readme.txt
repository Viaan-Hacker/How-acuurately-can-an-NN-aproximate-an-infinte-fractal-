This folder is where we will place the files related to neural networks. 


See the experiment flow and results in the Comparing Models.ipynb file.

testmodel.ipynb where we test some of our functions.
We did some preliminary Model testing in Sequential Model.ipynb.
mandelbrot.ipynb We generated and used the mandelbrot dataset for modeling.
In Julia.ipynb we generated and used the julia dataset for modeling.
Comparing models.ipynb We generated different Models for the mandelbrot set to conduct our final experiments.



You can reproduce our results in the Comparing Models.ipynb file, in order of the code blocks from top to bottom.
